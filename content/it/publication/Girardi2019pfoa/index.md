abstract: The aim of the present study was to examine the association between exposure to polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mortality (1970â€“2018) in a cohort of 462 male employees who had worked at least six months before 2009 for a factory (14,658 person-years; 107 deaths, average follow-up time 31.7 years), which had been producing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (PFOS) and other chemicals since 1968. The cohort showed increased mortality for all causes and subjects in the highest cumulative internal dose of PFOA had a statistically significant increase for mortality of liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, malignant neoplasms of lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue in both comparisons. Toxicological studies on PFOA and PFOS provide support for causality for the observed association with the risk for liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
